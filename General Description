During my BTech years, I came across a course where we were asked to code a hardware using HDL. I was so confused because I was never exposed to such domain. But as a learnt more
I became so much curious and excited thinking all the possible applications of using HDL. 
Now I'm a Masters Student at BITS, Pilani pursuing Masters in Microelectronics and VLSI Design

Thanks to Mr. Laurence Moroney, AI lead at Google and his suggestion through Linkdin Post, I have now decided to maintain this project on GIT HUB and keep practicing
and will not stop until I become a Design Engineer at Xilinx.

If you want to contribute or contact or suggest something Im always "OPEN"
