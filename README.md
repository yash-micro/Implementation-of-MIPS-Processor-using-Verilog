# Implementation-of-RISC-V-Processor-using-Verilog
This project describes on how to design a microarchitecture based on open source RISC-V ISA.
I will be designing a full fledged pipelined architecture
The processor will be a 32- bit processor with 5 stage pipelining 
It will be equipped with branch predictor and also a forwarding unit
